- Backend:python(Flash/Django) or Node.js (Express)
- Database: postgreSQL or MongoDB
- Version Control: Git & GitHub
- Design Tools: Figma for UI/UX design
  ## Goals
  -implement responsive UI/UX designs
  -structure a scalable full-stack web application
  -Build and integrate RESTful APIs
  -Ensure secure authentication & user management
## UI/UX Design Planning

### Importance of Identifying Design Properties in a Mockup
Understanding design properties helps developers and designers maintain **visual consistency, enhance user experience, and ensure accessibility**. By defining colors, typography, and UI elements beforehand, teams can avoid inconsistencies, speed up development, and create a cohesive, polished product. Clear design guidelines also improve communication between designers and developers, making collaboration smoother.
